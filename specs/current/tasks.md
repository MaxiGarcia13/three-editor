# Tasks — current

MVP status board. Detailed work lives in the open delta’s `tasks.md`; tick acceptance in `current/requirements.md` when a US ships and the delta is folded.

## Bootstrap (done when specs + AGENTS exist)

- [x] `AGENTS.md` + `specs/current/` + `CHANGELOG.md` + `specs/us-1/` … `specs/us-10/`

## Dependencies (before US-1 code)

- [x] Add `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, and Three type packages as needed

## US-1 — Model load & viewport

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Editor island + full-screen R3F viewport
- [x] Model upload + load into scene
- [x] Orbit / pan / zoom; empty and error states
- [x] Collapsible sidebar shell (`EditorSidebar` / `EditorPreview`)

## US-2 — Animation library & playback

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Multi-file animation import → clip library with skeleton validation
- [x] Clip selector + Play / Pause / Stop / loop
- [x] `AnimationMixer` on character root + timeline scrubber tied to mixer time
- [x] Track / bone mismatch shows a user-visible error (no silent retargeting)
- [x] Sidebar clip list with per-entry Replace / Remove; active clip picker lives in preview chrome

## US-11 — Model library

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Session model library (`models[]` + `activeModelId`); viewport still reads one `scene`
- [x] Multi-file model import; failed files do not join the library
- [x] Sidebar model list with Replace / Remove and a distinct previewed row
- [x] Switching preview: swap viewport graph, re-frame camera, rebind mixer, `syncClipsToSkeleton`
- [x] Remove previewed model → next loaded model or empty overlay
- [x] Clip import remains gated on a previewed model

## US-3 — Clip trim & time scale

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Start / End Time inputs for active clip
- [x] Clone → working window trim → replace working library entry
- [x] Session recoverability of pre-trim clip (`sourceClip` + re-trim from source)
- [x] Rebind mixer action after trim; update scrubber duration
- [x] Speed multiplier slider → per-clip `timeScale` (live via `mixer.timeScale` for the active clip)

## US-4 — Keyframe edit

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Pause / scrub from US-2 at an arbitrary timestamp
- [x] Raycast selection of bone / mesh; TransformControls attach + orbit conflict handling
- [x] Transform mode toolbar (translate / rotate / scale + W / E / R); gizmo in local space
- [x] “Hold Pose to End” + “Restore Pose” in preview (visible only when pose is dirty)
- [x] Capture local TRS; find/create Vector / Quaternion tracks; hold plateau playhead → clip end
- [x] Restore discards unsaved pose and re-applies clip at playhead

## US-5 — Zip export

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Bake helper for `timeScale !== 1` (clone clips; scale times / duration)
- [x] `GLTFExporter` adapter: model scene + matching working clips → `.glb`
- [x] `GLTFExporter` adapter: animation-only (empty/minimal scene + one working clip) → `.glb`
- [x] Zip helper; numeric suffix on filename collisions
- [x] “Download” sidebar control + blob download of the zip
- [x] Disable / error when nothing to pack; no partial zip on exporter failure

## US-13 — Selection name overlay

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] `SelectionNameOverlay` reads `$selection` and shows `Object3D.name`
- [x] Mounted in `EditorPreview` as a non-interactive floating label; hidden when nothing selected

## US-14 — Viewport general settings (axes)

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] `$viewportSettings` store (`axesVisible`, `axesSize`) under `viewport/stores`
- [x] General section in Settings sidebar (checkbox + metres input)
- [x] Conditionally render `WorldAxes` from `axesVisible`; length from `axesSize`

## US-12 — Rename library entries

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] `renameModel` / `renameClip` store handlers (stable ids; clip syncs embedded `AnimationClip.name`; empty names rejected)
- [x] `AssetEntry` inline rename (Finder-style basename select; restore `.glb`/`.gltf` if omitted on commit)
- [x] Wired from `ModelLibrary` and `ClipLibrary`; zip basenames follow renames

## US-6 — Cross-rig retargeting

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Bone / track alias registry + vendor adapters (`bone-vendors/`); suggestions only — Apply required
- [x] Retarget modal + mapping UI; This model | All models apply scope
- [x] Clip remap → playable working clip; incomplete maps error without corrupting pose
- [x] Library Retarget on mismatched clips (including after previewed-model switch)

## US-15 — Edit / Move tools + bind-pose save

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Edit / Move tool toggle; Move = world translate on model root
- [x] Dirty Save / Restore; bind-pose commit (no clip) + Hold Pose (active clip) + root translation (Move)
- [x] Bind-pose deltas rebase library clips and apply on import / replace / retarget
- [x] Auto-Restore on tool switch and selection change while dirty
- [x] Settings General: editable model-root X / Y / Z
- [x] Active Clip **T-pose** option restores rest / bind pose

## US-7 — Multi-clip blending

**Shipped** — folded into `current/`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [x] Dual-action mixer + weighted blend overlay (`blendClipId` / `blendWeight` / `blendBaseClip`)
- [x] New animation draft from scratch; library list selection; click-again → T-pose
- [x] Settings Blend collapsible: partner, weight, Bake, Reset (viewport-only until Bake)
- [x] Export stays discrete library clips (US-5); Bake commits mix into the active clip before pack
