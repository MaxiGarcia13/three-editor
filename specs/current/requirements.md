# Requirements — current

Living product contract for the **GLB Character & Animation Editor**.

## Product summary

Web editor with a full-screen 3D viewport and a collapsible sidebar. Users load one or more model GLBs (one previewed at a time), import animation clips, play and edit them (trim, speed, keyframes, weighted blend + bake, bind pose, whole-model move), and download a zip of per-model GLBs plus animation-only files.

**Stack:** Astro shell + React island; React Three Fiber + drei + Three.js.

## User stories

### US-1 — Model load & viewport

As an editor user, I can upload a model and view it in a full-screen 3D viewport.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can upload one `.glb` or `.gltf` that contains a skinned mesh and skeleton
- [x] Model appears in a full-screen R3F viewport with orbit / pan / zoom
- [x] Empty state when no model is loaded; clear error when load fails or skeleton is missing
- [x] Sidebar chrome is present and collapsible (shell may be minimal until later US)

### US-2 — Animation library & playback

As an editor user, I can import animation files into a clip library and play them on the loaded character.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can upload multiple separate `.glb` / `.gltf` files; their clips populate an animation library
- [x] Sidebar library lists each clip with Replace (re-pick file for that entry) and Remove
- [x] Active clip is selected from the Animations library list (same pattern as models); clicking the selected clip again clears to T-pose / bind pose when a model is loaded
- [x] Playback controls: Play, Pause, Stop, loop toggle
- [x] Timeline scrubber stays tied to `THREE.AnimationMixer` time
- [x] Clips that do not match the character skeleton (missing tracks / unknown bones) show a user-visible error — no silent retargeting

### US-3 — Clip trim & time scale

As an editor user, I can shorten a clip and change playback speed.

**Acceptance**

- [x] Start Time / End Time inputs trim the **working** copy of the active clip into a `[start, end]` window (track `trim` + time shift + duration on a clone — `AnimationClip.trim()` is a no-arg internal helper in three 0.185)
- [x] Trim always clones first so the pre-trim clip remains recoverable in the session
- [x] Speed multiplier slider stores `timeScale` on the **active** clip and drives live playback for that clip only
- [x] Export bake behavior for time scale is defined in design and followed when US-5 ships

### US-4 — Keyframe edit

As an editor user, I can pause on the timeline, move a selected bone/mesh, and save a keyframe at that time.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can pause at an arbitrary timestamp (scrub or pause during play)
- [x] Raycast selects a bone or mesh; TransformControls move the selection
- [x] “Hold Pose to End” and “Restore Pose” appear in the preview only after the selection’s local pose has been edited (TransformControls); hold captures local position / rotation / scale
- [x] Hold finds or creates the matching `VectorKeyframeTrack` / `QuaternionKeyframeTrack` on the **active** clip and writes a plateau from the clip-local playhead through clip duration so the pose holds for the rest of the animation; timestamp is timeline playhead (`[0, duration]`), not raw accumulated `mixer.time`. Re-edit later by scrubbing and holding again
- [x] Restore discards the unsaved gizmo edit and re-applies the active clip at the current playhead

### US-5 — Zip export

As an editor user, I can download a zip of each model and of each animation as separate files.

**Acceptance**

- [x] “Download” uses `GLTFExporter` and builds a zip in the browser — no server round-trip
- [x] Zip contains one `{model}.glb` per loaded model: that model’s scene plus **only** library clips that validate against that model’s skeleton (working / trimmed / keyed form)
- [x] Zip contains one `{clip}.glb` per library clip that has a working `AnimationClip` — animation-only, no mesh
- [x] Each clip’s stored `timeScale` is baked into that clip’s exported track times / duration per design
- [x] Filename collisions inside the zip get a numeric suffix
- [x] Download is disabled or errors when there is nothing to pack; exporter failure does not download a partial zip

### US-11 — Model library

As an editor user, I can keep several character GLBs in the session and choose which one the viewport shows.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can upload multiple `.glb` / `.gltf` files that each contain a skinned mesh and skeleton; they populate a model library
- [x] Sidebar library lists each model with Replace and Remove (same `AssetEntry` pattern as clips)
- [x] Exactly one model is **previewed** at a time; switching it swaps the viewport graph, re-frames the camera, rebinds the mixer, and re-validates the shared clip library
- [x] Removing the previewed model selects another loaded model, or empty state if none remain
- [x] Clip import still requires a previewed model

### US-13 — Selection name overlay

As an editor user, when I click a bone or part of the model, I can see its name in a floating label on the preview so I know what is selected.

**Acceptance**

- [x] When a bone or mesh is selected via raycast selection, a floating label on the preview shows that object’s `Object3D.name`
- [x] The label updates when the selection changes and is hidden when there is no selection
- [x] The overlay is non-interactive (`pointer-events-none`) and does not block orbit, picking, or the transform-mode toolbar

### US-14 — Viewport general settings (axes)

As an editor user, I can show or hide the world axes and change how far the metre rulers extend from the Settings sidebar.

**Acceptance**

- [x] Settings sidebar (`editor-settings-sidebar`) has a **General** section above Animation
- [x] General includes a checkbox to show/hide world XYZ axes (and X/Y metre rulers)
- [x] General includes a numeric control for axes length in metres
- [x] Toggling visibility mounts/unmounts axes in the viewport immediately
- [x] Changing length updates `axesHelper` and X/Y rulers live
- [x] Defaults match prior behavior: axes visible, length `10`
- [x] Settings are session-only (no persistence across reloads)

### US-12 — Rename library entries

As an editor user, I can rename a model or animation in the library so labels and exported filenames match what I intend.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can rename any model library entry; the new name appears in the sidebar and as the previewed-row label
- [x] User can rename any clip library entry (ready or errored); the new name appears in the sidebar, the active-clip selector, and related chrome that shows `ClipEntry.name`
- [x] Entry `id` stays stable across rename (selection, replace, retarget, and mixer bindings must not break)
- [x] Clip rename updates `ClipEntry.name` and, when present, `AnimationClip.name` on both the working `clip` and `sourceClip` so exported GLB animation metadata matches the library label
- [x] Model rename updates `ModelEntry.fileName` (the field used for display and zip naming)
- [x] Clip `sourceFile` stays the original import file name (provenance); rename does not rewrite it
- [x] Empty or whitespace-only names are rejected; the previous name is kept
- [x] Zip export (US-5) uses the renamed values for `{model}.glb` / `{clip}.glb` basenames (existing extension strip + collision suffix still apply)
- [x] Rename is keyboard-operable and labelled (NFR-4)

### US-6 — Cross-rig retargeting

As an editor user, I can apply an animation authored for a different rig to my loaded character via an explicit retarget mapping.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can open a retarget flow when imported clip tracks do not match the character skeleton
- [x] Mapping is explicit (auto-suggest allowed; silent remap without confirmation is forbidden)
- [x] Vendor bone prefixes (e.g. Mixamo) are handled only via a documented registry / mapping table — no hardcoded one-off string hacks in playback code
- [x] Successfully retargeted clips become playable working clips in the library
- [x] Unmapped clip bones may be left blank — Apply drops those tracks; Apply requires at least one mapped bone; other failures leave a clear error and do not corrupt the character pose
- [x] Retarget mapping UI opens in a modal (Settings aside stays available)
- [x] After switching the previewed model, clips that no longer match show Fix / Retarget for that character
- [x] **This model** apply: new ready clip for the current character; source clip kept
- [x] **All models** apply: one remapped library clip (source replaced) and every loaded model’s bones renamed to the mapping targets; fail clearly if a model cannot resolve the map
- [x] Apply UI offers an explicit This model / All models choice (no silent all-model normalize)

### US-15 — Edit / Move tools + bind-pose save

As an editor user, I can choose Edit or Move in the preview, pose bones/meshes or place the whole model on world X/Y/Z with or without an animation, and Save or Restore to confirm or discard.

**Acceptance**

- [x] When a model is loaded, preview chrome shows mutually exclusive **Edit** (`CursorIcon`) and **Move** (`MoveIcon`) tool toggles
- [x] **Edit:** raycast selects a bone or mesh; TransformControls support translate / rotate / scale (existing W / E / R toolbar when selected); works with **no** imported / active clip
- [x] **Move:** TransformControls translate the active model root on **world X / Y / Z** only; W / E / R toolbar is hidden; raycast does not switch selection away from the root
- [x] After a gizmo edit (either tool), **Save** and **Restore** appear in the preview until the user confirms or discards
- [x] **Edit + no active clip — Save:** commits the selection’s local TRS as the model bind pose (persists on the scene graph and in exported `{model}.glb`) **and** rebases that node’s tracks in **every** library clip by the pre-edit → current TRS delta (so later / existing animations keep the structural edit; the user does not re-hold per clip). The same accumulated delta is applied when importing or replacing clips while that model is active, and again after US-6 retarget remaps tracks onto the character bones
- [x] **Edit + active ready clip — Save:** keeps US-4 Hold Pose to End (plateau on the working clip from playhead to clip end)
- [x] **Move — Save:** commits the model root translation (persists on the scene graph and in exported `{model}.glb`); never writes animation keyframes
- [x] **Restore:** discards the unsaved gizmo edit (with an active clip in Edit mode, re-applies the clip at the playhead; otherwise restores the pre-edit TRS snapshot)
- [x] Switching Edit ↔ Move while dirty auto-Restores, then switches tools
- [x] Changing selection (pick another bone/mesh or clear) while dirty auto-Restores the pending edit on the previous object, then updates selection — preview TRS matches the discarded edit
- [x] Settings sidebar (`EditorSettingsSidebar` General) shows live **editable X / Y / Z** fields for the **model root position**, available whenever a model is loaded — **independent of Edit / Move tool**. Committing a number updates `scene.position`, marks dirty as a model-root edit, and uses the same Save / Restore path as Move-mode gizmo edits. (Bone/mesh local position is edited via the Edit gizmo, not these fields.)
- [x] Clicking the selected Animations list row (or otherwise clearing the active clip) restores the model’s current bind / rest pose in the preview so Edit-without-clip works without leaving an animation frozen on the last frame

### US-7 — Multi-clip blending

As an editor user, I can create a new animation from scratch or use an uploaded clip, preview a weighted blend with other library clips, and Bake when I want that mix written into the active clip.

**Acceptance**

- [x] User can start a **New animation** from the Library (`PlusIcon`) — creates an editable draft from scratch
- [x] Active animation is selected from the **Animations list** (same pattern as models)
- [x] Clicking a currently selected animation unselects it to T-pose
- [x] Draft and uploaded clips support Start/End, playback speed, playback, and keyframe edits on the active clip
- [x] Settings **Blend** is a collapsible; expanded form has partner select, weight, **Bake**, and **Reset**
- [x] Blend is viewport-only until Bake; Bake writes into the active clip and resets the form; Reset clears without writing
- [x] Unsaved pose edits discard on reselect; Hold Pose to End commits into the active clip
- [x] Export: discrete library clips only — live `blendClipId` / `blendWeight` are not packed; Bake must run first for a mix to appear in the zip (US-5)

### US-16 — FBX import via convert API

As an editor user, I can upload a `.fbx` model or animation file and have it converted to GLB so it loads like any other library asset.

**Acceptance**

- [x] Model import and Replace accept `.fbx` in addition to `.glb` / `.gltf`
- [x] Clip import and Replace accept `.fbx` in addition to `.glb` / `.gltf`
- [x] `.fbx` files are converted via `POST /api/v1/fbx-to-glb` **before** skeleton / clip validation; `.glb` / `.gltf` stay local (no convert hop)
- [x] After convert, library entry names use `{basename}.glb` so rename and zip export stay unchanged
- [x] Convert / oversize / non-fbx failures are user-visible (same surfaces as a bad GLB: model `error`, clip failed entry)
- [x] Convert API is a Vercel Node serverless function (`@astrojs/vercel`, not Edge); request body cap matches Vercel’s payload limit (typically 4.5MB)

## Post-MVP user stories

Deltas exist under `specs/us-8/` … `specs/us-10/`. Not started; do not implement until explicitly kicked off.

### US-8 — Morph-target editing

As an editor user, I can adjust morph target influences and save them as animation keyframes.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Morph list + influence sliders when morphs exist
- [ ] Live updates; save morph keyframes at `mixer.time` on the active clip
- [ ] Empty state without morphs; export includes morph tracks when present

### US-9 — Graph / curve keyframe UI

As an editor user, I can inspect and edit keyframe curves for tracks on the active clip.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Track list (filterable by selection); edit / add / delete keyframes
- [ ] Edits update the working clip and mixer; interpolation visible where supported

### US-10 — Full undo / redo

As an editor user, I can undo and redo animation edits within the session.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Undo / Redo UI + shortcuts for discrete clip mutations (trim, keyframes, …)
- [ ] Per-session stack; mixer never left on a stale clip; integrates with or replaces US-3 pre-trim restore

## Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-1 Modular domains:** Logic lives under `src/modules/<domain>/` (`editor-shell`, `viewport`, `animation`, `export`, `import`); pages stay thin
- **NFR-2 Layering:** No Three.js / R3F / Tailwind inside pure `services/` or `utils/`
- **NFR-3 Island boundary:** Canvas and editor interactivity hydrate as a client React island; Astro owns the static shell
- **NFR-4 Accessibility:** Sidebar controls are keyboard-operable and properly labelled
- **NFR-5 Asset contract:** Bone-name mismatch is an explicit error; no hardcoded vendor prefixes without a registry

## Out of scope (still excluded)

- Material / texture editing
- Server accounts (FBX convert via US-16 is the allowed server round-trip; no user accounts)
- Collaborative editing / durable undo across reloads
- Full NLA strip editorial beyond US-7 blend/cross-fade
- FBX larger than Vercel’s function payload (typically 4.5MB) until a later blob / chunked upload
